## Usage

Breadcrumbs are used to show taxonomical context on pages that are many levels deep in a siteâ€™s hierarchy. Breadcrumbs show and link to pages higher up in the ancestry.

Breadcrumbs are most appropriate on pages that:

- Are many levels deep on a site
- Do not have a section-level navigation
- May need the ability to quickly go back to the previous (parent) page
- All items must contain links, with the last item as the user's current context

## Anatomy

Breadcrumbs are made of links (indicating parents), dividers, and the current page which presents itself as plain text and not a link. The default breadcrumbs component can be modified to change the number of items within the chain.

## Options

Breadcrumbs have different variants and different lengths they can support:

### Variants

Breadcrumb component offers two variants. A default variant where links aren't highlighted and an accent variant that applies an accent color to the parent links.

- Use the default variant for most use cases in service of am effective use of color.
- Use the accent variant for use cases where breadcrumb is at the center of the experience, for example a multiple level FAQ.

### Breadcrumb length

By default the breadcrumbs component can show up to 10 items within the chain plus the current page.
